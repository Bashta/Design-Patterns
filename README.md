# Design Patterns in Swift 📚✨

This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns implemented in Swift. Each design pattern is organized into its own section, providing an overview, use cases, pros, and cons.

 ### 🎨 Pattern Overview

 The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates the creation of objects into separate factory classes, allowing the client code to create objects through these factories without directly instantiating them.

 ### 🚀 Use Case

 The Abstract Factory pattern is useful in scenarios where:

 - The system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
 - The system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
 - The family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and this constraint needs to be enforced.
 - You want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.

 ### 👍 Pros

 - Provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
 - Promotes loose coupling between the client code and the product classes, as the client deals only with the abstract interfaces.
 - Allows for easy switching between different families of products without modifying the client code.
 - Enforces the use of related products together, ensuring consistency.

 ### 👎 Cons

 - Introduces additional complexity due to the creation of multiple factory classes and interfaces.
 - Requires the addition of new concrete factory classes when introducing new product families, which can be cumbersome.
 - May result in a large number of small files in the codebase, increasing the project's complexity.

Stay tuned for more design patterns to be added to this repository! We'll be covering a wide range of creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, providing detailed explanations and Swift implementation examples.

Feel free to explore the code and learn how to apply these design patterns in your own Swift projects. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy coding! 😄🚀
